# Outside Traffic Adjuster

This very lightweight mod allows you to adjust the spawn rate of outside connection to outside connection traffic (also known as dummy traffic).  
Road, train, ship, and plane traffic spawnrates can be individually adjusted.

## Adding and removing from an existing save
* This mod can be safely added to and removed from an existing save, as this mod does not alter savedata.

## Compatability
* There are no current known incompatabilities with this mod

## Notes
* While the mod seems to work with decreased spawnrates, increased spawnrates don't seem to have a noticeable impact.

## Credits
* StarQ/Qoushik for the help implementing this mod
