# Outside Traffic Adjuster

This mod allows you to adjust the spawn rate of outside connection to outside connection traffic (also known as dummy traffic).  
Road, train, ship, and plane traffic spawnrates can be individually adjusted.
I find this to be especially useful for train traffic, where outside traffic could easily clog up your rail network.

## Adding and removing from an existing save
* This mod can be safely added to and removed from an existing save, as this mod does not alter savedata.

## Compatability
* There are no current known incompatabilities with this mod

## Notes
* I'm not exactly sure what the game does with the spawn rate value, and while the mod seems to work with decreased spawnrates, increased spawnrates don't seem to have that big of an impact.
* This mod uses a less invasive approach to altering spawnrate, so it should be less susceptible to mod-breaking updates.

## Credits
* To dex3r for the original mod, and tduck973564's Traffic Simulation Adjuster for the prefab patcher code.
